# Node.js on Google Cloud by example

This series of examples of gradually increasing complexity assumes only a
rudimentary knowledge of JavaScript, but otherwise no other knowledge.
As you go through the examples, you will gain hands-on experience and skills
building server apps with the following:
* [Node.js] - a JavaScript runtime for apps (like fast servers)
* [Express] - a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js
* [Mocha] - a simple, flexible, and fun test framework
* [Node.js client] - for access to other backend [Google APIs]
* [Google Cloud's serverless platform] - for running apps on Cloud Run, Cloud Functions, and AppEngine
* [Cloud Build] - Google's serverless CI/CD platform
* [Operations suite] - tools for monitoriting and analyzing app performance
* [Docker] - the modern approach to packaging apps as portable containers
