# Node.js on Google Cloud by example

This series of examples on gradually increasing complexity assumes only a
rudimentary knowledge of JavaScript, but otherwise no other knowledge of
* [Node.js] - a JavaScript runtime for apps (like fast servers)
* [Express] - a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js
* [Mocha] - a simple, flexible, and fun test framework
* [Google Cloud's serverless platform] (Cloud Run, Cloud Functions, AppEngine)
* [Cloud Build], Google's serverless CI/CD platform
* [Docker] - the modern approach to packaging apps as portable containers

As you go through the examples, you will gain hands-on experience with the following
* Creating [Node.js] server apps
* That use [Express] for the web framework
* That use [Mocha] for automated tests
* That use [Cloud Build] to test and then deploy your apps
* That are deployed to [Google Cloud's serverless platform]
* That can use the [Node.js client] to access other [Google APIs] for data, workflows, and other services
* That can be monitored and analyzed with Google Cloud's [operation suite]
