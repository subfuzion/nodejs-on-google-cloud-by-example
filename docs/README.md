# Node.js on Google Cloud by example

This is a series of examples that gradually build on each other to help you
gain hands-on experience and skills creating server apps with Node.js that
run on Google Cloud. To get started, you only need basic knowledge of
JavaScript and Node.js.

After going through this series of examples, you will have gained a good
understanding of building and running Node.js services on Google Cloud
and acquired usefull skills working with the following:

* [Node.js] - a JavaScript runtime for apps (like fast servers)
* [Express] - a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js
* [Mocha] - a simple, flexible, and fun test framework
* [Node.js client] - for access to other backend [Google APIs]
* [Google Cloud's serverless platform] - for running apps on Cloud Run, Cloud Functions, and AppEngine
* [Cloud Build] - Google's serverless CI/CD platform
* [Operations suite] - tools for monitoriting and analyzing app performance
* [Docker] - the modern approach to packaging apps as portable containers
